# python-file-opening
A code to read files from python !!!

This is a program to open a file in python 
but remember it only opens file which is in the python directory folder .
and you can read and write but write is usually not used 
so ditch it . It wont help you get a job !!
yah it uses   open()   function. 


Use only python 3 or later 

not python 2
